# dotfiles

All those configuration things. Clone this repo into `~/.dotfiles` and then use [rcm](http://thoughtbot.github.io/rcm/)'s `rcup` to symlink files into their appropriate locations. You probably want to run `rcup -x "README* LICENSE Brewfile sublime iterm2"` initially, since the `.rcrc` file won't be installed yet.

This was created on a computer running macOS, so some pieces are macOS-specific.
